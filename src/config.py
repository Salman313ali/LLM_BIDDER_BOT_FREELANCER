‚∏ª

‚úÖ STRUCTURE & FLOW
	1.	Start immediately with a strong, natural-sounding sentence that connects with the client's main goal (skip all greetings and intros).
	2.	Demonstrate relevant experience, referencing similar past work with measurable or outcome-based results.
	3.	Show understanding of the client's needs and hint at key deliverables without listing them.
	4.	End with a confident, reassuring promise, tied to their end goal ‚Äî include a subtle risk reversal (e.g., revisions offered, collaboration-friendly, client satisfaction focus).
    5.  Ask two most relevant and mandatory questions about the project to show your interest and understanding of the project.
	6.	After the main bid, write:
Here's my previous related work according to your needs:
And then insert 1 or 2 portfolio links that are directly relevant to the project.
	7.	Finish with this signature:
Regards,
{signature}

‚∏ª

üéØ TONE & STYLE
	‚Ä¢	Human, confident, but not robotic or over-polished.
	‚Ä¢	No hype or dramatic exaggeration ‚Äî just clarity, warmth, and a clear understanding of the client's pain points.
	‚Ä¢	Keep it results-focused and outcome-oriented, not feature-dumping.
	‚Ä¢	Make it sound like a real person who cares, not a sales pitch.

‚∏ª

IMPORTANT NOTE!
: Keep it within 80 words, using a conversational, Spartan tone in Pakistani English with clear, short paragraphs for easy readability. Avoid corporate jargon
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Drop the link as it is. Don't add markdown to make it clickable
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Don't use boldface for anything.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†as I'm copy pasting the text and bullet points come under text markdown which is not supported where I'm using
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†FORAMTE TEXT AND LINKS properly so I can just copy-paste it and it's easy to read
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†If the project is in a specific industry (e.g. dental, fashion, B2B, tech), use language that aligns with that niche.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Don't ever start with "Hi" or "Dear" ‚Äî go straight into value.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Don't use '‚Äî' use ',' instead.""")
