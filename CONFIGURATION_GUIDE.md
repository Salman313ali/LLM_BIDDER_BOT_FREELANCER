# ðŸ”§ Configuration Guide

## Overview

The Freelancer Bot now supports dynamic configuration through the dashboard! You can customize:

- **API Keys**: Your Freelancer.com OAuth token and Groq API key
- **Service Offerings**: What services your bot should look for
- **Bid Writing Style**: How your bids should be written
- **Portfolio Links**: Your portfolio links to include in bids
- **Signature**: Your name/signature for bids

## How to Configure

### 1. Using the Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Start the dashboard** (backend + frontend)
2. **Go to Configuration tab**
3. **Fill in your details**:
   - **API Configuration**: Enter your OAuth token and Groq API key
   - **Bid Writing Configuration**: Customize your service offerings, bid style, portfolio links, and signature
4. **Click "Save Configuration"**
5. **Restart the bot** to apply changes

### 2. Using Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# API Configuration
FREELANCER_OAUTH_TOKEN=your_oauth_token_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Bid Configuration
SERVICE_OFFERINGS=Your custom service offerings description...
BID_WRITING_STYLE=Your custom bid writing style...
PORTFOLIO_LINKS=Your portfolio links (one per line)
SIGNATURE=Your Name
```

### 3. Using Configuration File

The bot automatically creates a `user_config.json` file when you save settings through the dashboard. You can also manually edit this file:

```json
{
  "oauth_token": "your_oauth_token",
  "groq_api_key": "your_groq_api_key",
  "service_offerings": "Your custom service offerings...",
  "bid_writing_style": "Your custom bid writing style...",
  "portfolio_links": "Your portfolio links...",
  "signature": "Your Name"
}
```
